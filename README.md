# Day 1 (Python)

  1)Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. --> naturalNums.py 
  
  
  2)Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string). --> argstring.py
  
  
  3)Write a code that receives an array of numbers or strings, goes one by one through it while taking one value out, leaving one value in, taking, leaving, and back   again to the beginning until all values are out. It's like a circle of people who decide that every second person will leave it, until the last person is there.    So if the last element of the array is taken, the first element that's still there, will stay. The code returns a new re-arranged array with the taken values by  their order. The first value of the initial array is always taken. --> yes_no.py
 
 # Day 2 (Java) 
 
 1)Problem: Given a string s, write a method (function) that will return true if its a valid single integer or floating number or false if its not.
 
 2)Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one single private integer variable Side, a getter GetSide() and a setter SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, getter and setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more professional...
